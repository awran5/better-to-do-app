## CRUD To-Do App using React Hooks with Context API and LocalStorage

This project was forked from [Task-manager](https://github.com/lashaNoz/Task-manager) project created by [lashaNoz](https://github.com/lashaNoz/) I just did some cleanup and modifications to make it better.

### Modified:

- Completed Task Logic
- App HTML re-structure
- serviceWorker
- Style Animation
- Removed FontAwesome (inline SVG added)

### CodeSandbox
